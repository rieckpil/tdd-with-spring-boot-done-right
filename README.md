## Introduction

Boost your productivity with TDD (Test-Driven Development) and Spring Boot to accelerate your development. Build better, faster, and safer.

- **No Fluff:** We don't want to religiously convince you. Take this course and see it for yourself. Apply what works for you and avoid cargo-cult.
- **Beyond The Basics:** Test fails, test passes, refactoring? But how to do TDD for legacy code? How to do it remotely within a team? We'll answer that.
- **Real-World Examples**: TDD for a Game or Calculator is simple. That's playground and doesn't prepare you. We go for real world hands-on examples.
- **Productivity Boost:** Write more maintainable code. Get confidence by adding a covering test suite for your project to sleep better at night.

The TDD with Spring Boot Done Right Online Courses focuses on teaching the TDD with Java and Spring Boot.

We won't cover all technical details of testing with Spring Boot, but rather focus on the TDD methodology and how to apply it in.

If you're new to testing with Java and Spring Boot, we highly recommend to first work through the [Testing Spring Boot Applications Masterclass](https://rieckpil.de/testing-spring-boot-applications-masterclass/) before taking this course.

# Local Project Setup

## Requirements

Mandatory requirements:

* Java 21 (JDK flavour (OpenJDK/Azul/Oracle) does not matter). For the correct Java version setup I can recommend [JEnv](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FVZyeFDXo0) (Mac/Linux) and the [Maven Toolchains Plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-toolchains-plugin/toolchains/jdk.html) (Windows)

```
$ java -version
openjdk version "21.0.6" 2025-01-21 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-21.0.6+7 (build 21.0.6+7-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-21.0.6+7 (build 21.0.6+7-LTS, mixed mode, sharing)
```

* Docker Engine (Community Edition is enough):

```
$ docker version
Client: Docker Engine - Community
 Version:           20.10.6
